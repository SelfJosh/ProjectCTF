### Hello anyone interested in the development of my game and the source code for it all

I will be trying my best to update my github repo with the latest build, but currently, the game is nowhere close to playable. As I continue to update this github page with the different changes to the game I hope that I can eventually look back and see my progress as a game dev.

This ReadMe will serve as a timeline for the changes made in the game and will also have updates that are currently being worked on and when/if they get implemented. I have lots of ideas for this beginning game with failure in mind so that progress can be made with my coding.

>*Please keep in mind I am making this game as a solo indie game developer with some course work under my belt. Most of this code is self-taught and all sprites/images/animations have also been made by me. While progress may be slow I will work and update my game as much as possible.*
